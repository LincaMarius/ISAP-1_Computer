## About the project, brief description

The goal of this project is to create a more efficient version of the SAP (Simple As Possible) Computer.
    
Credits are given to Albert Paul Malvino and Jerald A. Brown for introducing this architecture in their book "Digital Computer Electronics" and Ben Eater for implementing his own version of the SAP Computer using IC's and breadboards.

An interesting fact is that I discovered a girl who made the SAP-1 calculator using breadboards in October 2011, and Ben Eater in February 2015, so 4 years earlier! This is that video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkTMICyp6xA. She built the SAP-1 computer using breadboards for a school project. It's a pity that the video presented is not of better quality.

## Stages of the project:
[ 1 - Design requirements; ](https://github.com/LincaMarius/ISAP-Computer/blob/main/Stage1/Stage1.md) \
[ 2 - Design improvement by analyzing and modifying the block diagram; ](https://github.com/LincaMarius/ISAP-Computer/blob/main/Stage2/Stage2.md) \
3 - Simulate functionality using one of the programs: Logisim, Logisim Evolution, LTspice, NI Multisim, Proteus, OrCAD, TINA, CircuitMaker, Simulink, etc. I will use Ligisim;\
4 - Electrical diagram design using one of the programs: KiCAD, Altium Designer, Eagle, OrCAD, Fusion 360, Proteus, etc. - I will use KiCAD;\
5 - Prototype creation and functionality testing;\
6 - PCB design;\
7 - Testing the new product;\
8 - Final product assembly;\
9 - Subsequent revisions of the product as often as necessary.

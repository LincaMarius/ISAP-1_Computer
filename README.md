## About the project, brief description

The goal of this project is to create a more efficient version of the SAP (Simple As Possible) Computer.
    
Credits are given to Albert Paul Malvino and Jerald A. Brown for introducing this architecture in their book "Digital Computer Electronics" and Ben Eater for implementing his own version of the SAP Computer using IC's and breadboards.

An interesting fact is that I discovered a girl who made the SAP-1 calculator using breadboards in October 2011, and Ben Eater in February 2015, so 4 years earlier! This is that video: \

 She built the SAP-1 computer using breadboards for a school project. It's a pity that the video presented is not of better quality.

## ISAP-1 version 1
The initial version I want to be a redesign of the SAP-1 computer. For this purpose, we must go through the steps followed by the authors of the original project.

### Step 1 – Block Diagram optimization
The first stage of any project is the realization of the block diagram through which the overall picture of the designed system can be viewed, where the component blocks and the links between them can be seen.

This is my step-by-step process of optimizing the functionality of the ISAP-1 computer at the block diagram level:

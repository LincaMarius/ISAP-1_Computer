# ISAP-1 Computer version 0.1
The initial version I want to be a redesign of the SAP-1 computer. For this purpose, we must go through the steps followed by the authors of the original project.

Version 0.1 will be an implementation of the SAP-1 computer that is as close to the original as possible, capable of executing only the “Fetch” portion of an instruction. This will be the reference, the starting point for creating a better version.

## Instruction Set Analysis
In this step, the original Instruction Set of the SAP-1 Computer is studied.

I will redraw the Timing Diagrams for each instruction individually.

I will also present the Truth Tables corresponding to each instruction.

## Block Diagram
The first stage of any project is drawing the Block Diagram, which allows you to visualize the overall picture of the designed system, where you can see the component blocks and the connections between them.

The analysis of the Block Diagram of the SAP-1 computer is the starting point for the creation of the ISAP-1 computer:

## Control Block Design
This step is necessary to complete the next step.

I treated the Control Block design separately because it is more complicated and involves several distinct stages.

# ISAP-1 version 0.1
The initial version I want to be a redesign of the SAP-1 computer. For this purpose, we must go through the steps followed by the authors of the original project.

Version 0.1 will be an implementation of the SAP-1 computer that is as close to the original as possible, capable of executing only the “Fetch” portion of an instruction. This will be the reference, the starting point for creating a better version.

## Instruction Set Analysis
In this step, the original Instruction Set of the SAP-1 Computer is studied.

I will redraw the Timing Diagrams for each instruction individually.

I will also present the Truth Tables corresponding to each instruction.

The analysis of the Block Diagram of the SAP-1 computer is the starting point for the creation of the ISAP-1 computer:
